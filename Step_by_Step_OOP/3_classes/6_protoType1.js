// Prototype: Is a mechanism by which objects can inherit features from one another. 
//            every JavaScript object has a hidden, internal property called [[Prototype]], which either points 
//            to another object (its prototype) or null. This forms what's known as the prototype chain and is 
//            fundamental to JavaScriptâ€™s inheritance system.
