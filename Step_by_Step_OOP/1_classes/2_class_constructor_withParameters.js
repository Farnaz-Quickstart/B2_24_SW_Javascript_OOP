// this:
//     Refers to the Instance: Inside a class, this refers to the specific instance being created or acted upon.
//     also this is used to set up properties on the specific object being created
//     Uniqueness: Each new instance of a class has its own separate properties (like this.brand, this.model, etc.), 
//     so changing this.brand on one instance does not affect another instance.
